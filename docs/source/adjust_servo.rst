Adjust Servo for Assembly
==========================

Before assembling the servo, 
the angle needs to be set to zero. 
This is because the servo motor has a limited range of motion, 
setting the angle to zero degrees ensures that the servo is in its 
initial position and does not exceed its range of motion when the servo is powered on. 
If the servo is not set to zero degrees prior to assembly, 
it may attempt to exceed its range of motion when powered, 
potentially damaging the servo or the mechanical system it is connected to. 
Therefore, setting the angle to zero is an important step to ensure the 
safe and normal operation of the servo motor.

**For Python User**

Please refer to :ref:`quick_guide_python` to complete the 
installation of the Raspberry Pi OS and adjust the angle of the servos.


**For Ezblock User**

After you have installed the ezblock system, 
the P11 pin can be used to adjust the servo. 
Please refer to :ref:`ezb_servo_adjust` for details.
